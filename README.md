# SonarRockandMinePrediction
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model which can differentiate mines and rocks based on sonar data.

The dataset is available at the UCI ML Repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/151/connectionist+bench+sonar+mines+vs+rocks. The dataset has been collected by bouncing sonar signals off a metal cylinder and rocks at various angles and under various conditions.
